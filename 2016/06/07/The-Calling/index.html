        <p>My name is Jacob Burton. Who I am is ultimately of little consequence in the cosmic story of God’s plan; still, the Gospel is all I have to share with you, and my testimony tells of how the Gospel led a handful of mere men to grasp for a dream too big for their childish hands. You could consider this madness, or you could consider it a calling. I consider it both.</p>
<p>It began somewhere around a year and a half ago. In truth, it began long before that. I was ten years old when I first felt an urging to go abroad. That urging was first realized my junior year of college when I was blessed to live for a year in the Sultanate of Oman. My feet had not yet left Omani soil before I was planning and scheming how to get back to the Middle East or East Africa (the two families I lived with in Oman were both from Tanzania).</p>
<p>Upon arriving back to the States, God brought a beautiful woman into my life. I don’t just mean she looked beautiful, she did, but I mean she <em>is</em> beautiful. Beautiful in the same way that drove Adam to perform the first love song in the presence of Eve; beautiful in the way that leaves your heart and soul longing to sing because mere words are not enough. She had just gotten back to the States after a year spent in Botswana and Zimbabwe. God knit us together in ways I hope one day still to fit into words or song. Meg and I married each other seven months later in a conference room at the Cheesecake Factory, surrounded by our closest family. We serve a God who makes us lay down in green pastures. He is a strong tower in whom the righteous take refuge. Meg and I entered a season of laying by quiet streams under the shade of His wing. God is so good.</p>
<p>I scraped together enough credits to get a computer science minor before graduating. By God’s grace and divine providence, I landed a programming job at a respected software company in Boulder, CO. I grew quickly and soon moved onto a startup team as a co-founder of Waffle.io. I grew to truly enjoy developing and entrepreneurship. Even in our season of rest though, Meg and I both knew in the depths of our souls that we were called to be in Africa. It wasn’t simply a desire or a dream. How can I put it … it is like when a song draws emotion from hidden corners of your heart and you <em>feel</em>. You feel in ways you could never hope to explain to another person. In that moment, the music is truer than anything else. It is you, and you do not need reason or words to describe it. That is how I felt. God was already laying out a road before our feet, and it lead to Africa.</p>
<p>We waited. Content to rest while God had it for us to rest, we decided we would enjoy our new life together and be ready to go when He said it was time. Love begets creativity. Our love created three beautiful children: Abbie, Zephania, and Kaeleb. They are treasured gems, specifically gifted and lovingly positioned in our family.</p>
<p>Then God said, “go”.</p>
<p>This brings us back to a year and a half ago. I was spending time in prayer and reading one weekend. The Holy Spirit opened my eyes. He had grown me into a developer, an entrepreneur, and a disciple. What he laid on my heart that weekend lit a fire inside me. I had been reading economic reports the past several weeks on the rise of Africa. In the next 100 years, these articles stated, Africa will be leading the world. “Make it a Christian Africa”, God said to me.</p>
<p>OK … I’ll get right on that….</p>
<p>It just so happened that a family had recently started coming to our church who was involved in ministry in the Middle East and Africa. They were at the forefront of my mind as I prayed over this calling, the Holy Spirit’s fingerprint, and I knew I needed to talk with them. Andre and I met not soon after and I shared with him what God had put on my heart. God has a way of calling us to things we are unable to achieve within human means; however, He has a way of growing communities around such missions and showing off as He accomplishes them in front of our eyes. Andre was not only excited about what I shared with him, but God had been growing this vision within him for years … I was late to the party. Typical. Andre and I decided to parter almost immediately. It was a partnership that quickly grew to become a deep friendship. There is a deep mystery in Christian brotherhood. It is not often found, and I cherish my brotherhood with Andre every day. God is so good.</p>
<p>We got to work. We dreamed, we planned; we got excited, we got confused; we strategized, we prayed. At the end of the day, we knew God had a plan and it was in Africa. The last thing Africa needs is two more white guys coming in with dreams and solutions to make their lives better. This would only work if God provided Africans to partner with us. We needed to go to Africa.</p>
